      <description>Using Git and Github Git is a Unix command used for sharing code and other computer files with colleagues.
Github is a popular place on the web to store your code and other computer files, either privately or for the whole world to see. These collections are organized into units (like folders) called repositories.
Git is also used for version control when working on a large computer project, where you need to keep track of changes in many different files, possibly written by many different people.</description>
